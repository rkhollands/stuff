GetInternetTime.exe (GIT) is a clock-setting app for businesses that close after 2:00AM.

Since the sudden change of Daylight Savings Time can cause disruptions, business can use this utility to choose a more appropriate time to change their clocks. It does this through the Windows Task Scheduler (run with full admin privileges).

GIT can run in edit mode, or automatic. Open the application without command-line parameters to enable edit mode. There a user can change options, modify Daylight Savings Time (DST) rules, and even test the app.

Run the app with a 'R' command-line parameter to run in automatic. This will launch the app, get Greenwich Mean Time, apply time zone and DST adjustments, and change the clock. Then it will exit. The shortcut 'Run Automatic GetInternetTime.exe' is configured to supply the appropriate argument.
